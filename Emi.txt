<h1>Fly Emirates</h1>


<h2>History of The Emirates Group</h2>

<p>    The <i>Emirates Group</i> is composed of airport services provider
 <b>DNATA</b> (the Dubai National Air Transport Association) and Emirates Airlines.
 Owned by the government of Dubai and based at the busiest airport in the Middle East,
 Emirates has flourished under the sheikdom's 'wide open skies' policy, in spite of the restrictions
 placed on it by other countries. The airline, renowned for its luxurious in-flight service, was unique 
among long-haul airlines in that it had not joined a global alliance such as the Star Alliance or oneworld by the 
beginning of the new millennium.</p>

   <li><h3>Origins</h3></li>
</ul>


<p>    <b>Dubai</b>, a fishing village at the southern end of the Arabian Gulf, 
has grown to become one of the leading trade centers of the Middle East, 
fueled at first by pearls, then petroleum. The Beni Yas tribe assumed control of 
the town around 1830. The Maktoum family led the tribe throughout the 19th and 20th
 centuries. Dubai became one of seven sheikdoms in the United Arab Emirates, which was formed in 1970.

As the British pulled out of Dubai in the late 1950s, Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum decreed an open
 seas, open skies, and open trade policy, to develop the country into a regional crossroads for
 trade and tourism. He also required all government agencies to make a profit. The country was aiming 
to eliminate its dependence on its finite oil reserves within 50 years.
The Dubai National Air Transport Association (DNATA) was formed in 1959. By the mid-1980s, 
DNATA had grown to 2,500 employees. In addition to providing support services at Dubai Airport,
 the company served as sales agent for 26 airlines. Dubai had been used as a stopover on routes 
between Europe and the Far East since the days of Imperial Airways (precursor to British Airways), which
 landed its flying boats there en route to Australia. Its open skies policies kept its airport among the busiest in the region.<p>

 <span class="img-container"><img src="emii.jpg"></span> <pre style="font-family:areal;">  Gulf Air began to cut back its service to Dubai in the mid-1980s. As a result, 
Emirates Airlines was conceived in <mark>March 1985</mark> with backing from Dubai's royal family, whose Dubai Air Wing provided 
two of the airline's first aircraft, used Boeing 727s. (An Airbus A300 and Boeing 737 were two others.) 
Because of Dubai's unique political structure, wrote Douglas Nelms in Air Transport World, Emirates could 
be described as both government-owned and privately held, though most considered it state-owned. It was
 required to operate independent of government subsidies, however, apart from $10 million in start-up capital.

Maurice Flanagan was named managing director of the new airline. Formerly of the Royal Air Force, 
British Airways, and Gulf Air, Flanagan had been seconded to DNATA in 1978 on a two-year assignment as assistant general sales manager.

Chairman was Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, nephew of the ruler of Dubai. Only 27 years 
old in 1985, he had graduated from the University of Colorado just four years earlier (his degree 
was in political science and economics). Sheik Ahmed also became chairman of Dubai Civil Aviation and 
DNATA itself. Although he lacked any direct experience in the airline industry, Sheikh Ahmed embraced
 his new role, learning to fly a variety of aircraft along the way. As Lisa Coleman duly noted in Chief 
Executive, he was indeed experienced in one area that would be the new airline's defining trait: luxury. 
From the beginning, Emirates boasted a tradition of providing the best creature comforts available at 40,000 feet.

The first flight, Dubai-Karachi on October 25, 1985, was a Pakistani connection in more ways than one. The 
airline leased the aircraft, an Airbus 300, from Pakistan International Airlines. Bombay and Delhi were the 
other two earliest destinations. From the beginning, Emirates flights carried both passengers and cargo.

Emirates was profitable within nine months. During its first year, it carried 260,000 passengers and 10,000 
tons of freight. Gulf Air, part owned by the much more wealthy neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, had previously
 dominated air traffic in the region. Its profits fell more than 30 percent during the first year of its new
 rival's operations, however, prompting Gulf Air to drop its privatization plans. The next year, Gulf Air posted a loss.

In its second year, Emirates also posted a loss, before setting out on decades of profitable growth. 
One reason for the success of Emirates was its aggressive marketing. Another was the high level of 
in-flight service in its new Airbus aircraft, which it outfitted with generously spaced seating.

<img src="emiii.jpg">In 1986, Colombo, Dhaka, Amman, and Cairo were added to the route network. Emirates launched daily
 nonstop service to London (Gatwick) on July 6, 1987 with two new Airbus A310s. This complemented the
 overnight flights British Caledonian was sending to and from Dubai. Other destinations added in 1987 
were Frankfurt via Istanbul, and Male (Maldive Islands). Emirates lacked a regional feeder network since
 most of its neighboring countries were shareholders in rival Gulf Air.

This impressive early growth came as the region was experiencing a business downturn, with the Gulf 
War a contributing factor, and the subsequent laying off of expatriate workers--both bad news for the 
air travel industry. In its second year, competitors accused Emirates of starting a price war. The airline
 countered that its lower fares were stimulating traffic, not stealing it from its rivals. By the end of 1987,
 <em>Emirates</em> was serving 11 destinations.
