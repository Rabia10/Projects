<h1>Coronavirus Covid-19</h1>

<h2>Find Out What Your Child Already Knows</h2>

<h3>Ask questions geared to your child's age level.</h3>
<p>For older kids, you might ask, "What are you hearing 
about coronavirus? What questions do you have?" For younger children,
 you could say, "Do you have questions about the new sickness that's going around?"
 This gives you a chance to learn how much kids know — and to find out if they're hearing
 the wrong information.</p>

<h3>Follow your child's lead.</h3>
<p>Some kids may want to spend time talking.
 But if your kids don't seem interested or don't
 ask a lot of questions, that's OK.</p>

<h2>Offer Comfort — and Honesty</h2>

<h3>Focus on helping your child feel safe, but be truthful.</h3>
<p>Don't offer more detail than your child is interested in. 
For example, if kids ask about stores closing,
 address their questions. But if the topic doesn't
 come up, there's no need to raise it.</p>

<h3>If your child asks about something and you don't know the answer, say so.</h3>
<p> Use the question as a chance to find out together. Check the Centers
 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for up-to-date,
 reliable information about coronavirus (COVID-19). That way, 
you have the facts and kids don't see headlines about deaths and other scary information.</p>

<h3>Speak calmly and reassuringly.</h3>
<p> Explain that most people who get sick feel 
like they have a cold or the flu. Kids pick up on it when
 parents worry.
 So when you talk about coronavirus and the news, use a calm voice and try not to seem upset.</p>


<h3>Give kids space to share their fears. </h3>
<p>  It's natural for kids to worry, "Could I be next? Could that
 happen to me?" Let your child know that kids don't seem to get as sick as adults.
 Let them know they can always come to you for answers or to talk about what scares them.</p>

<h3>Know when they need guidance. </h3>
<p>  Be aware of how your kids get news and information, 
especially older kids who go online. Point them to age-appropriate content so
 they don't end up finding news shows or outlets that scare them or have incorrect information.</p>
